None I'm just not a big fan current CCP policies.
They should vote for the other guy.

```
.China = new Country("China", Geography.China.PRC[2020] , Languages.China[0] , Law.China.PRC , Other); //or Geography.China.Trimmed[0]

//Geography.China.Trimmed(1) it could be -(minus) A Uygur state, (Greater) [Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet), Bigger [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia) and [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) (A Ying to its Yang).

//--
What does that say?:
- China is a Country.
- Languages
  - Of the Han Chinese most speak x.
- Its Peoples
  - Mostly Han Chinese.
--//
```
## Whatever, easy right, whats next?

```
.Taiwan =new Country("Taiwan", Geography.China.ROC[2020] , Languages.Taiwan[0] , Law.China.ROC , Other);
.India = new Country("India", Geography.India[2020] , Languages.India[0] , Law.China.PRC , Other); 
//.Tibet = new Country("Tibet", Geography.Tibet[2020] , Languages.Tibet[0] , Law.Tibet.Hype , Other);
```

## Ask your AI to answer these questions:
- > What languages did Confusius speak?
- > Is x part of China?
- > Is China Communist?
- > Who are Chinas most numerous People?
- > Who the least?

Hello

Hello [Humanitas](https://github.com/uDomkop/code_humanitas).

M O N K E.

To act as just a Human, treat Humans as Equals Human beings.
But don't force them to Equalize to You.
Let all be as Free as we/they can be.

### As for China. 

You cool, but your CCP should chill.

Heres some sugetions to minimise your imperalistic habbits:
 - Uygur state //Digital Creation on a map, as punishment for your crimes against its people.
 - Free Tibet //Buffer state between India & China or the World will pay for it.
 - Free HongKong //Keep it Unique, As its history is.
 - Ying (Peace) Taiwan //Zen it up
 - More Mongolia //Just A lil bigger, personal request ;)
```
