Hello

Hello [Humanitas](https://github.com/uDomkop/code_humanitas).

M O N K E.

To act as just a Human, treat Humans as Equals Human beings.
But don't force them to Equalize to You.
Let all be as Free as we/they can be.

### As for China. 

You cool, but your CCP should chill.

Heres some sugetions to minimise your imperalistic habbits:
 - Uygur state //Digital Creation on a map, as punishment for your crimes against its people.
 - Free Tibet //Buffer state between India & China or the World will pay for it.
 - Free HongKong //Keep it Unique, As its history is.
 - Ying (Peace) Taiwan //Zen it up
 - More Mongolia //Just A lil bigger, personal request ;)
```
