### As for China. 

You cool, but your CCP should chill.

Heres some sugetions to minimise your imperalistic habbits:
 - Uygur state //Digital Creation on a map, as punishment for your crimes against its people.
 - Free Tibet //Buffer state between India & China or the World will pay for it.
 - Free HongKong //Keep it Unique, As its history is.
 - Ying (Peace) Taiwan //Zen it up
 - More Mongolia //Just A lil bigger, personal request ;)
