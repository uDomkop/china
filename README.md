# China & Truth

If you're China, act like China.
Not like an (Westen) Imperial.
As Japan was. //Burry the Hatchet

Do as Confusius say, is that China?
Is that not what China is?
Is China Communist?
Communism caused a transformation.

"C - h - i - n - a"
  - Donald Trump

Doctronising People.
Into talking the "right" way.
That is not China, or it?
No China, should be is its people. //Most Chinese are Han Chinese (>90%). Which is ~20% of world!

To act as just a Human, treat Humans as Equals Human beings.
But don't force them to Equalize to You.
Let all be as Free as we can be.

Heres some sugetions to minimise your imperalistic habbits:
 - Uygur state //Digital Creation on a map, as punishment for your crimes against its people.
 - Free Tibet //Buffer state between India & China or the World will pay for it.
 - Free HongKong //Keep it Unique, As its history is.
 - Ying (Peace) Taiwan //Zen it up
 - More Mongolia //Just A lil bigger, personal request ;)
