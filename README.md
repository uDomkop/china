# China & Truth

If you're China, act like China.
Not like an (Westen) Imperial.
As Japan was. //Burry the Hatchet

Doctronising People.
Into talking the right way.
Is that not what China is?
Is China Communist?
Communism caused a transformation.

"C - h - i - n - a"
  - Donald Trump

Do as Confusius say, is that China?
No China, should be is its people, most of which are Han Chinese (>90%). //Which is ~20% of world).




That is not China, or it?

To act a Human, and to act as Equals.

Heres some sugetions to minimise your imperalistic habbits:
 - Uygur state //Digital Creation on a map, as punishment for your crimes against its people.
 - Free Tibet //Buffer state between India & China or the World will pay for it.
 - Free HongKong //Keep it Unique, As its history is.
 - Ying (Peace) Taiwan //Zen it up
 - More Mongolia //Just A lil bigger, personal request ;)
